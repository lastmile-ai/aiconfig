# NOTE: This assumes you have the aiconfig conda environment created.
# You will be prompted for a username and password. For the username, use __token__. 
# For the password, use the token value, including the pypi- prefix.
# To get a PyPi token, go here: 
# Need to get a token from here (scroll down to API Tokens): https://pypi.org/manage/account/
