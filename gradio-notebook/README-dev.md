## If running for the FIRST TIME and building on this

Otherwise, go directly to [dev instructions](https://github.com/lastmile-ai/gradio-workbook/blob/main/gradioworkbook/README-dev.md#follow-these-steps-if-you-are-developing-locally)

Just a heads up, the process for getting local development setup for the first time can be a bit tricky!

### Environment Setup

1. Install node.js & yarn
   - Latest Node version from [website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) using the package installer
   - After installing Node, open a new terminal to install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable): `sudo npm install --global yarn`
2. Gradio uses `pip` and `python` for executing commands so you must symlink `python` and `pip` (aliasing is not enough) to `python3` and `pip3`:
   - `python3 -m pip install --upgrade --force pip` ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55494352))
   - force `python` to be symlinked to `python3` ([instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71957847))
3. Install Gradio itself: `pip install gradio`

### Setting up Gradio repo

1. Go to the project where this is defined. Ex: `~/Projects/gradio-workbook`
3. Gradio uses `pip` and `python` for executing commands so you must symlink `python` and `pip` (aliasing is not enough) to `python3` and `pip3`:
   - `python3 -m pip install --upgrade --force pip` ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55494352))
   - force `python` to be symlinked to `python3` ([instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71957847))
4. Run the command `gradio cc create GradioWorkbook --overwrite`. This will install the necessary setups and dependencies
5. `cd .. && rm -rf gradio-workbook`
6. Clone the repo again: `git clone https://github.com/lastmile-ai/gradio-workbook.git` (with Sapling: `sl clone https://github.com/lastmile-ai/gradio-workbook.git`)
7. `cd gradio-workbook` and follow the steps below!

## Follow these steps if you are developing locally!

```bash
cd gradioworkbook
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd frontend && yarn && yarn dev
```
