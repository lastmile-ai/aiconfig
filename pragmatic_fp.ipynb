    "# How to get the most out of this notebook\n",
    "## Main points to understand first, Tl;Dr\n",
    "* Don't worry about artificial distinctions or paradigms. Don't be afraid of new things.\n",
    "* Instead, use specific sets of tools like type checkers, design patterns, and language features to your advantage.\n",
    "* Use those tools judiciously to achieve your goals (like program efficiency, user/programmer experience, and correctness). \n",
    "* Correctness is _the single most important_ property of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "* Open in VSCode with Pylance enabled. \n",
    "* Make sure your pyrightconfig.json has   \"typeCheckingMode\": \"strict\"\n",
    "* Hover over code to get inferences from Pyright. \n",
    "  * This includes both inferred types and errors.\n",
    "* Go through the cells in order, reading the markdown text and code in order. It's like a story book.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming Concepts (Feel free to skip if you're in a hurry)\n",
    "* There are no \"paradigms\". OO or functional programming are not categories or \"paradigms\" of languages, but instead (fuzzy) sets of PL _features_. \n",
    "  * E.g. is Python OO or FP? Well, it has classes, objects, and methods. It also has map and filter, as well as very Pythonic syntactic sugar for complex compositions of those higher-order functions (it's called a list comprehension).\n",
    "* There is also no well-defined idea of \"strong\" or \"weak\" typing. These terms are used loosely to refer to certain sets of PL typing features. Usually, \"strongly typed\" means there are certain obligatory type annotations (see below).  \n",
    "* Static typing vs. dynamic typing. \n",
    "  * It is NOT an either-or. It is NOT a spectrum. It is at least two independent dimensions. \n",
    "  * Case in point: C is statically but not dynamically typed. Java is both statically and dynamically typed. Python2 is dynamically but not statically typed. Assembly is neither.\n",
    "  * Typing is a set of _features_ of a PL (programming language), not a type of PL.  \n",
    "* Type _inference_ vs. type _annotation_.\n",
    "  * Type inference is the process of outputting type information given source code. Since it is done only from source code and not from program execution, by definition the type information is _static_. This process is done in different ways by different static analysis tools like ghc, tsc, javac or Pyright. Essentially, this is where the _computer_ tells _you_ (and itself) the static type.\n",
    "  * Type inference is not the same thing as manual type annotation or type hinting. Type annotation is the inclusion of explicit type information inside source code for use by both static analysis tools and human readers. Sometimes it is obligatory (e.g. Java) and sometimes not (e.g. Python3). Essentially, this is where _you_ tell the _computer_ the static type.\n",
    "* Type safety and proof of correctness\n",
    "  * Correctness is the most important property of a program. If it outputs the wrong answer (or crashes, or hangs forever) then it is useless no matter how efficiently it runs, how nice the user/programmer interface is, or how maintainable the code is. EXAMPLES:\n",
    "    * Consider a web app for buying plane tickets. Imagine it takes 1 minute to get a confirmation. Now imagine it runs in 1 second, but you show up to the airport and the flight is actually sold out and they don't have your confirmation.\n",
    "    * Some institutions (like banks) run extremely old Cobol programs that no one can reliably change anymore. It still works, and it's better than no working code.    \n",
    "  * Type inference and annotation/hinting are each features of PLs that can be used in different ways by static analysis tools to reduce program errors.\n",
    "    * For example, you can ask Pyright to infer all of your types with no explicit annotations. You can further constrain your program's types by adding annotations.\n",
    "    * When considering program correctness, there is no important difference between an explicit, annotated type and an inferred type. They are different kinds of _constraints_ on the static types of a program.\n",
    "  * Using a combination of constraints from type hints and inference procedures, tools like Pyright can statically detect errors in your program if they exist. \n",
    "    * This is also what compilers like javac (or gcc) do. If you get the types wrong, javac will fail and not output any Java bytecode. If it _does_ compile (or if Pyright reports no errors), then you are guaranteed a certain degree of correctness during program execution, depending on the exact PL and static analysis specifications. \n",
    "  * Notice that the goal of type safety is the same as the goal of test cases: proving correctness. The more you lean on your static analysis tools, the less you have to rely on tests. Put another way, static analysis will save you time to write _better_ tests that can prevent even more errors. \n",
    "    * Also notice that tests cannot run statically. You have to actually run some piece of your code to get a proof of correctness from a test case.\n",
    "* Functions as data\n",
    "  * Functions are already data no matter what PL you are working in. Your PL may be hiding this fact via its own higher-level abstractions. At the lowest level (i.e. in the von Neumann architecture), programs, which includes functions, are data.\n",
    "  * Some PLs introduce high-level abstractions that maintain the treatment of functions as data. Many of these are known as \"functional PLs\", but that term is misleading just like \"strongly typed\". \n",
    "    * For example, like Haskell, Python and Java have high-level abstractions for functions as data. Namely, anonymous functions (lambda expressions)."

    "The two expressions have the same form, in the sense that they construct values of a specific container type by evaluating a sequence of `for` expressions. In both cases, you start at the first `for`, go in order until you're done with the last `for`, then come back up to the top and evaluate an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you might be wondering why they are so different despite those similarities. In `result.do()`, we have `Ok` and `Err` values, `Err` values short-circuit, and there's no actual iteration over a sequence. Every `Result` is exactly one `Ok` or exactly one `Err`. With list comprehensions, we are iterating over an arbitrary number of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is that this notation abstracts over a class of different concrete \"chainable\" types. Result is one such type; list is another. They are different by construction, and _defined_ by their distinct chaining rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of `list`, \"chaining\" is actually _defined_ to involve flattening. Actually, list chaining involves a little more than just flatten: it maps a function over each element, and then flattens. It's called `flatMap`:"

This is also called purity, and is distinct from a program whose execution involves mutation or other side effects. One of the essential features of OOP is mutation, which is called \"encapsulation\" in OOP. In contrast, one of the essential features of FP is immutability or purity, which implies referential transparency.\n",
    "- Code organization: OOP tends to organize around bundles of mutable state and functions that do that mutation, namely classes/objects. FP sometimes bundles related functions into modules, but does not organize around mutating a piece of state using those functions. \n",
    "- Different kinds of polymorphism: OOP-compatible languages like Python or Java bundle together code reuse (inheritance) and ad-hoc polymorphism (subtyping) through subclassing. FP often achieves the same objectives (at a high level) through higher-order functions, but there aren't obvious 1:1 feature mappings.\n",
    "- One thing that is shared between OOP and FP is the other major type of polymorphism, parametric polymorphism, which is essentially generic types. This is distinct from ad-hoc polymorphism, which takes different forms in different languages. In OOP style, ad-hoc polymorphism usually comes in the form of dynamic dispatch via subclassing. Both FP and OOP styles use ad-hoc polymorphism in the form of overloading."
