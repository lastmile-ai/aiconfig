    context: " New England open to neutrals.\nFrom that time nothing entered or left\
      \ the blockaded coast except swift\nprivateers, or occasional fast-sailing vessels\
      \ which risked capture\nin the attempt. Toward the close of the year Admiral\
      \ Warren extended\nhis blockade eastward. Notice of the extension was given\
      \ at Halifax\nNovember 16, and by the blockading squadron off New London December\
      \ 2,\nthus closing Long Island Sound to all vessels of every description.[381]\n\
      \nThe pressure of the blockade was immediately felt. In August[382]\nsuperfine\
      \ flour sold at Boston for $11.87 a barrel, at Baltimore for\n$6.00, and at\
      \ Richmond for $4.50. Upland cotton sold at Boston for\ntwenty cents a pound;\
      \ at Charleston for nine cents. Rice sold at\nPhiladelphia for $12.00 a hundred\
      \ weight; in Charleston and Savannah\nfor $3.00. Sugar sold in Boston for $18.75\
      \ a hundred weight; in\nBaltimore for $26.50. Already the American staples were\
      \ unsalable at\nthe places of their production. No rate of profit could cause\
      \ cotton,\nrice, or \nwheat to be brought by sea from Charleston or Norfolk\
      \ to\nBoston. Soon speculation began. The price of imported articles rose to\n\
      extravagant points. At the end of the year coffee sold for thirty-eight\ncents\
      \ a pound, after selling for twenty-one cents in August. Tea which\ncould be\
      \ bought for $1.70 per pound in August, sold for three and four\ndollars in\
      \ December. Sugar which was quoted at nine dollars a hundred\nweight in New\
      \ Orleans, and in August sold for twenty-one or twenty-two\ndollars in New York\
      \ and Philadelphia, stood at forty dollars in\nDecember.\n\nMore sweeping in\
      \ its effects on exports than on imports, the blockade\nrapidly reduced the\
      \ means of the people. After the summer of 1813,\nGeorgia alone, owing to its\
      \ contiguity with Florida, succeeded in\ncontinuing to send out cotton. The\
      \ exports of New York, which exceeded\n$12,250,000 in 1811, fell to $209,000\
      \ for the year ending in 1814. The\ndomestic exports of Virginia diminished\
      \ in four years from $4,800,000\nto $3,000,000 for 1812, $1,\nand supplied the\
      \ Union\nwith articles of necessary use at prices practically fixed by her own\n\
      manufacturers. From the whole country specie began to flow toward\nBoston as\
      \ early as the year 1810, and with astonishing rapidity after\nthe war was declared.\
      \ The British blockade stimulated the movement,\nand the embargo of December,\
      \ 1813, which lasted till April, 1814, cut\noff every other resource from the\
      \ Southern and Western States. Unable\nlonger to send their crops even to New\
      \ England for a market, they were\nobliged to send specie, and they soon came\
      \ to the end of their supply.\nThe Massachusetts banks, which reported about\
      \ $820,000 in specie in\n1809, returned more than $3,680,000 in June, 1812;\
      \ which rose to\n$5,780,000 in June, 1813, and reached nearly $7,000,000 in\
      \ June, 1814.\nIn five years the Massachusetts banks alone drew more than six\
      \ million\ndollars in specie from the Southern and Middle States,[478] besides\n\
      what they sent to Canada in payment for British bills.\n\nNo one knew how much\
      \ s\nn be given to it.\u201D\n\nAlthough Madison pointed to the notorious supply\
      \ of food for the\nBritish forces in Canada as one of the motives for imposing\
      \ an embargo,\nno one supposed that motive to be decisive. Other laws already\
      \ forbade\nand punished such communication with the enemy; and experience proved\n\
      that a general embargo would be no more effective than any special\nprohibition.\
      \ The idea that England could be distressed by an embargo\nseemed still less\
      \ likely to influence Government. Congress knew that\nRussia, Prussia, Denmark,\
      \ Sweden and Norway, Spain, and South America\nwere already open to English\
      \ commerce, and that a few days must decide\nwhether Napoleon could much longer\
      \ prevent Great Britain from trading\nwith France. The possibility of distressing\
      \ England by closing Boston\nand Salem, New Bedford and Newport to neutral ships\
      \ was not to be\nseriously treated.\n\nWhatever was the true motive of the President\u2019\
      s recommendation,\nCongress instantly approved it. The next day, December 10,\
      \ the Hou\nr was responsible,\nthe effect was ruinous. The New England banks\
      \ were financial agents\nof the enemy. The bank capital of Massachusetts including\
      \ Maine was\nabout twelve and a quarter million dollars; that of Connecticut\n\
      exceeded three millions. The whole bank capital of New England reached\neighteen\
      \ millions,[477] or nearly one third of the paid bank capital\nof the whole\
      \ country, if Pitkin\u2019s estimate was correct. That nearly\none third of\
      \ the national resources should be withdrawn from the aid\nof government was\
      \ serious enough; but in reality the loss was much\ngreater, for New England\
      \ held a still larger proportion of the specie\non which the bank circulation\
      \ of other States depended.\n\nThe system of commercial restrictions was responsible\
      \ for thus, at\nthe most critical moment of the war, throwing the control of\
      \ the\nnational finances into the hands of the Boston Federalists. Against\n\
      the protests of the Federalists, manufactures had been forced upon\nthem by\
      \ national legislation until New Engl\n17, 1813; Annals, 1813\u20131814, p.\
      \ 2781.\n"
