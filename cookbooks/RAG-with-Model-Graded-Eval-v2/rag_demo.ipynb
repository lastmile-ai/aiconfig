The price of imported articles rose to\\nextravagant points. At the end of the year coffee sold for thirty-eight\\ncents a pound, after selling for twenty-one cents in August. Tea which\\ncould be bought for $1.70 per pound in August, sold for three and four\\ndollars in December. Sugar which was quoted at nine dollars a hundred\\nweight in New Orleans, and in August sold for twenty-one or twenty-two\\ndollars in New York and Philadelphia, stood at forty dollars in\\nDecember.\\n\\nMore sweeping in its effects on exports than on imports, the blockade\\nrapidly reduced the means of the people. After the summer of 1813,\\nGeorgia alone, owing to its contiguity with Florida, succeeded in\\ncontinuing to send out cotton. The exports of New York, which exceeded\\n$12,250,000 in 1811, fell to $209,000 for the year ending in 1814. The\\ndomestic exports of Virginia diminished in four years from $4,800,000\\nto $3,000,000 for 1812, $1,\\nNew England open to neutrals.\\nFrom that time nothing entered or left the blockaded coast except swift\\nprivateers, or occasional fast-sailing vessels which risked capture\\nin the attempt. Toward the close of the year Admiral Warren extended\\nhis blockade eastward. Notice of the extension was given at Halifax\\nNovember 16, and by the blockading squadron off New London December 2,\\nthus closing Long Island Sound to all vessels of every description.[381]\\n\\nThe pressure of the blockade was immediately felt. In August[382]\\nsuperfine flour sold at Boston for $11.87 a barrel, at Baltimore for\\n$6.00, and at Richmond for $4.50. Upland cotton sold at Boston for\\ntwenty cents a pound; at Charleston for nine cents. Rice sold at\\nPhiladelphia for $12.00 a hundred weight; in Charleston and Savannah\\nfor $3.00. Sugar sold in Boston for $18.75 a hundred weight; in\\nBaltimore for $26.50. Already the American staples were unsalable at\\nthe places of their production. No rate of profit could cause cotton,\\nrice, or \\nand supplied the Union\\nwith articles of necessary use at prices practically fixed by her own\\nmanufacturers. From the whole country specie began to flow toward\\nBoston as early as the year 1810, and with astonishing rapidity after\\nthe war was declared. The British blockade stimulated the movement,\\nand the embargo of December, 1813, which lasted till April, 1814, cut\\noff every other resource from the Southern and Western States. Unable\\nlonger to send their crops even to New England for a market, they were\\nobliged to send specie, and they soon came to the end of their supply.\\nThe Massachusetts banks, which reported about $820,000 in specie in\\n1809, returned more than $3,680,000 in June, 1812; which rose to\\n$5,780,000 in June, 1813, and reached nearly $7,000,000 in June, 1814.\\nIn five years the Massachusetts banks alone drew more than six million\\ndollars in specie from the Southern and Middle States,[478] besides\\nwhat they sent to Canada in payment for British bills.\\n\\nNo one knew how much s\\nr was responsible,\\nthe effect was ruinous. The New England banks were financial agents\\nof the enemy. The bank capital of Massachusetts including Maine was\\nabout twelve and a quarter million dollars; that of Connecticut\\nexceeded three millions. The whole bank capital of New England reached\\neighteen millions,[477] or nearly one third of the paid bank capital\\nof the whole country, if Pitkin’s estimate was correct. That nearly\\none third of the national resources should be withdrawn from the aid\\nof government was serious enough; but in reality the loss was much\\ngreater, for New England held a still larger proportion of the specie\\non which the bank circulation of other States depended.\\n\\nThe system of commercial restrictions was responsible for thus, at\\nthe most critical moment of the war, throwing the control of the\\nnational finances into the hands of the Boston Federalists. Against\\nthe protests of the Federalists, manufactures had been forced upon\\nthem by national legislation until New Engl\\nhe\\nrate was about 7.50 per cent. In the end, the government paid 7.487\\nper cent, for the use of these sixteen millions for thirteen years.\\nThe terms were not excessive when it was considered that New England\\nin effect refused to subscribe. Perhaps the loan could not have been\\ntaken at all, had not credit and currency been already expanded to the\\ndanger-point, as the allotment showed; for while New England, where\\nmost of the specie was held, subscribed less than half a million, and\\nBoston took but seventy-five thousand, Pennsylvania, where banking had\\nbecome a frenzy, took seven million dollars. New York and Baltimore\\ntogether contributed only half a million more than was given by\\nPhiladelphia alone. Ten million dollars were taken by Astor, Girard,\\nand Parish,--three foreign-born Americans, without whose aid the money\\ncould not have been obtained on these terms, if at all. Doubtless they\\nwere bold operators; but Americans were supposed to be not wanting in\\nthe taste for speculation, and\\n17, 1813; Annals, 1813–1814, p. 2781.\\n\\n[468] Act of Jan. 25, 1814; Annals, 1813–1814, p. 2788.\\n\\n[469] Annals, 1813–1814, p. 1965.\\n\\n[470] Macon to Nicholson, April 6, 1814; Nicholson MSS.\\n\\n[471] Gallatin MSS.\\n\\n[472] Annals, 1813–1814, p. 928.\\n\\n[473] Armstrong to Eppes, Feb. 10, 1814; Niles, vi. 94.\\n\\n[474] Note to abstract of regular troops in service, January, 1814;\\nadjutant-general’s office.

Nothing could be better calculated to support the Russian\\nmediation in the President’s mind. The possibility of remaining without\\na friend in the world while carrying on a war without hope of success,\\ngave to the Czar’s friendship a value altogether new.\\n\\nOther news crossed the ocean at the same time, but encouraged no hope\\nthat England would give way. First in importance, and not to be trifled\\nwith, was the British official announcement, dated December 26, 1812,\\nof the blockade of the Chesapeake and Delaware. Americans held that\\nthis blockade was illegal,[18]--a blockade of a coast, not of a port; a\\npaper-\\n the Indian signers to declare war on the British.\\nNeither Harrison’s nor Jackson’s treaty embraced the chief body of\\nhostile Indians; but Harrison’s treaty served another purpose of no\\nsmall value in appearing to remove an obstacle to negotiation with\\nEngland.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\n\\n\\nBADLY as the United States fared in the campaign of 1813, their\\nsituation would have been easy had they not suffered under the\\nannoyances of a blockade continually becoming more stringent. The\\ndoctrine that coasts could be blockaded was enforced against America\\nwith an energy that fell little short of demonstration. The summer was\\nwell advanced before the whole naval force to be used for the purpose\\ncould be posted at the proper stations. Not until May 26 did Admiral\\nWarren issue at Bermuda his proclamation of “a strict and rigorous\\nblockade of the ports and harbors of New York, Charleston, Port Royal,\\nSavannah, and of the river Mississippi,” which completed the blockade\\nof the coast, leaving only the ports of \\nblockade, one of the grievances against which the war was waged;\\nbut whatever they might choose to call it, they could not successfully\\ndisprove its efficiency, or deny that it made Chesapeake Bay, Delaware\\nRiver, and the Vineyard Sound little better than British waters. Export\\nof American produce from the Chesapeake and Delaware ceased.\\n\\nThe blockade, though serious beyond all other military measures,\\nroused less attention and less protest than another measure of the\\nBritish government which had the character of a profitable insult. A\\ncircular dated November 9, addressed to the governors of West Indian\\ncolonies by the British government, authorized them to issue licenses\\nfor importation of necessary supplies during the war,--a precaution\\ncommonly taken to meet the risk of famine in those regions. The\\nGovernor of the Bermudas, in issuing a proclamation January 14, 1813,\\npublished the circular, which contained one unusual provision:[19]--\\n\\n    “Whatever importations are proposed to be m\\n nor any\\nmeasures that could be taken by sea or land, prevented a constant\\ntraffic between Halifax and the New England ports not blockaded. The\\nUnited States government seemed afraid to interfere with it. The\\nnewspapers asserted that hundreds of Americans were actually in Halifax\\ncarrying on a direct trade, and that thousands of barrels of flour were\\nconstantly arriving there from the United States in vessels carrying\\nthe Swedish or other neutral flag. In truth the government could do\\nlittle to enforce its non-intercourse, and even that little might prove\\nmischievous. Nothing could be worse than the spirit of the people on\\nthe frontier. Engaged in a profitable illicit commerce, they could only\\nbe controlled by force, and any force not overwhelming merely provoked\\nviolence or treason. The Navy Department had no vessels to send there,\\nand could not have prevented their capture if vessels in any number had\\nbeen sent. The Secretary of War had abandoned to the State governments\\nthe defence \\n ruining the peasantry. We drive all their cattle, and of\\ncourse ruin them. _My_ hands are clean; but it is hateful to see the\\npoor Yankees robbed, and to be the robber.”\\n\\nCompared with the widespread destruction which war brought on these\\nregions half a century afterward, the injury inflicted by the British\\nnavy in 1813 was trifling, but it served to annoy the Southern\\npeople, who could offer no resistance, and were harassed by incessant\\nmilitia-calls. To some extent the same system of vexation was pursued\\non the Northern coast. The Delaware River was blockaded and its\\nshores much annoyed. New York was also blockaded, and Nantucket with\\nthe adjacent Sounds became a British naval station. There Sir Thomas\\nHardy, Nelson’s favorite, officer, commanded, in his flag-ship the\\n“Ramillies.” Hardy did not encourage marauding such as Cockburn\\npractised, but his blockade was still stringent, and its efficiency was\\nproved by the failure of Decatur’s efforts to evade it.\\n\\nDecatur commanded a squad\\ned States outside of New England did\\nnot exceed $150,000 a month, or at the rate of $1,800,000 a year.[384]\\n\\nNo ordinary operations of war could affect the United States so\\nseverely as this inexorable blockade.

On the other hand, Boston bought freely British Treasury notes\\nat liberal discount, and sent coin to Canada in payment of them.[481]\\nProbably New England lent to the British government during the war more\\nmoney than she lent to her own. The total amount subscribed in New\\nEngland to the United States loans was less than three millions.\\n\\nThis situation was well understood by Congress. In the debate of\\nFebruary, 1814, the approaching dangers were repeatedly pointed out.\\nThe alarm was then so great that the Committee of Ways and Means\\nreported a bill to incorporate a new national bank with a capital of\\nthirty million dollars, while Macon openly advocated the issue of\\ngovernment paper,[482] declaring that “paper money never was beat.”\\nCongress after a diffuse debate passed only a loan bill for twenty-five\\nmill\\npecie the country contained. Gallatin afterward\\nestimated it at seventeen million dollars,[479] and of that amount the\\nbanks of New England in 1814 probably held nearly ten millions. The\\nMassachusetts banks, with seven millions in specie, had a bank-note\\ncirculation of less than three millions. The Middle, Southern, and\\nWestern States must have had a bank-note circulation approaching forty\\nmillions in paper, with seven or eight millions in specie to support\\nit,[480] while the paper was constantly increasing in quantity and the\\nspecie constantly diminishing. Bank paper, as was believed, could not\\nwith safety exceed the proportion of three paper dollars to every\\nspecie dollar in the bank vaults; but the banks in 1814 beyond New\\nEngland were circulating at least four paper dollars to every silver\\nor gold dollar, and in many cases were issuing paper without specie in\\ntheir possession.\\n\\nAlready the banks of New England were pressing their demands on those\\nof New York, which in their turn ca\\nevery moment multiplying. Suffocated with\\nheat, members were forced to sit day by day in the half-finished\\nCapitol, with a Southern village about them, their nearest neighbor a\\nBritish fleet. “Defeated and disgraced everywhere,” said one of the\\nstanchest war members describing the scene, “Congress was to impose the\\nburden of taxes on a divided people, who had been taught by leaders\\nof the war party to look upon a tax-gatherer as a thief, if not to\\nshoot him as a burglar.”[36] According to the same authority, “the\\ncountry was at the lowest point of depression, where fear is too apt to\\nintroduce despair.” In this condition of spirits, Gallatin’s tax-bills\\nwere reported to the House June 10,--measures such as the Republican\\nparty had, till very lately, not conceived as within the range of its\\npossible legislation. They included a direct tax of three million\\ndollars; taxes on salt, licenses, spirits, carriages, auctions, sugar\\nrefineries; a stamp tax, and a complete machinery for the asses\\n27, 1814,[152] when the war\\nhad lasted two years,--\\n\\n    “Two thirds of the army in Canada are at this moment eating beef\\n    provided by American contractors, drawn principally from the States\\n    of Vermont and New York. This circumstance, as well as that of the\\n    introduction of large sums of specie into this province, being\\n    notorious in the United States, it is to be expected Congress\\n    will take steps to deprive us of those resources, and under that\\n    apprehension, large droves are daily crossing the lines coming into\\n    Lower Canada.”\\n\\nThis state of things had then lasted during three campaigns, from\\nthe beginning of the war. The Indians at Malden, the British army at\\nNiagara, the naval station at Kingston were largely fed by the United\\nStates. If these supplies could be stopped, Upper Canada must probably\\nfall; and they could be easily stopped by interrupting the British line\\nof transport anywhere on the St. Lawrence.\\n\\nThe task was not difficult.

On the other hand, Boston bought freely British Treasury notes\\nat liberal discount, and sent coin to Canada in payment of them.[481]\\nProbably New England lent to the British government during the war more\\nmoney than she lent to her own. The total amount subscribed in New\\nEngland to the United States loans was less than three millions.\\n\\nThis situation was well understood by Congress. In the debate of\\nFebruary, 1814, the approaching dangers were repeatedly pointed out.\\nThe alarm was then so great that the Committee of Ways and Means\\nreported a bill to incorporate a new national bank with a capital of\\nthirty million dollars, while Macon openly advocated the issue of\\ngovernment paper,[482] declaring that “paper money never was beat.”\\nCongress after a diffuse debate passed only a loan bill for twenty-five\\nmill\\npecie the country contained. Gallatin afterward\\nestimated it at seventeen million dollars,[479] and of that amount the\\nbanks of New England in 1814 probably held nearly ten millions. The\\nMassachusetts banks, with seven millions in specie, had a bank-note\\ncirculation of less than three millions. The Middle, Southern, and\\nWestern States must have had a bank-note circulation approaching forty\\nmillions in paper, with seven or eight millions in specie to support\\nit,[480] while the paper was constantly increasing in quantity and the\\nspecie constantly diminishing. Bank paper, as was believed, could not\\nwith safety exceed the proportion of three paper dollars to every\\nspecie dollar in the bank vaults; but the banks in 1814 beyond New\\nEngland were circulating at least four paper dollars to every silver\\nor gold dollar, and in many cases were issuing paper without specie in\\ntheir possession.\\n\\nAlready the banks of New England were pressing their demands on those\\nof New York, which in their turn ca\\nevery moment multiplying. Suffocated with\\nheat, members were forced to sit day by day in the half-finished\\nCapitol, with a Southern village about them, their nearest neighbor a\\nBritish fleet. “Defeated and disgraced everywhere,” said one of the\\nstanchest war members describing the scene, “Congress was to impose the\\nburden of taxes on a divided people, who had been taught by leaders\\nof the war party to look upon a tax-gatherer as a thief, if not to\\nshoot him as a burglar.”[36] According to the same authority, “the\\ncountry was at the lowest point of depression, where fear is too apt to\\nintroduce despair.” In this condition of spirits, Gallatin’s tax-bills\\nwere reported to the House June 10,--measures such as the Republican\\nparty had, till very lately, not conceived as within the range of its\\npossible legislation. They included a direct tax of three million\\ndollars; taxes on salt, licenses, spirits, carriages, auctions, sugar\\nrefineries; a stamp tax, and a complete machinery for the asses\\n27, 1814,[152] when the war\\nhad lasted two years,--\\n\\n    “Two thirds of the army in Canada are at this moment eating beef\\n    provided by American contractors, drawn principally from the States\\n    of Vermont and New York. This circumstance, as well as that of the\\n    introduction of large sums of specie into this province, being\\n    notorious in the United States, it is to be expected Congress\\n    will take steps to deprive us of those resources, and under that\\n    apprehension, large droves are daily crossing the lines coming into\\n    Lower Canada.”\\n\\nThis state of things had then lasted during three campaigns, from\\nthe beginning of the war. The Indians at Malden, the British army at\\nNiagara, the naval station at Kingston were largely fed by the United\\nStates. If these supplies could be stopped, Upper Canada must probably\\nfall; and they could be easily stopped by interrupting the British line\\nof transport anywhere on the St. Lawrence.\\n\\nThe task was not difficult.

Americans held that\\nthis blockade was illegal,[18]--a blockade of a coast, not of a port; a\\npaper-\\n the Indian signers to declare war on the British.\\nNeither Harrison’s nor Jackson’s treaty embraced the chief body of\\nhostile Indians; but Harrison’s treaty served another purpose of no\\nsmall value in appearing to remove an obstacle to negotiation with\\nEngland.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\n\\n\\nBADLY as the United States fared in the campaign of 1813, their\\nsituation would have been easy had they not suffered under the\\nannoyances of a blockade continually becoming more stringent. The\\ndoctrine that coasts could be blockaded was enforced against America\\nwith an energy that fell little short of demonstration. The summer was\\nwell advanced before the whole naval force to be used for the purpose\\ncould be posted at the proper stations. Not until May 26 did Admiral\\nWarren issue at Bermuda his proclamation of “a strict and rigorous\\nblockade of the ports and harbors of New York, Charleston, Port Royal,\\nSavannah, and of the river Mississippi,” which completed the blockade\\nof the coast, leaving only the ports of \\nblockade, one of the grievances against which the war was waged;\\nbut whatever they might choose to call it, they could not successfully\\ndisprove its efficiency, or deny that it made Chesapeake Bay, Delaware\\nRiver, and the Vineyard Sound little better than British waters. Export\\nof American produce from the Chesapeake and Delaware ceased.\\n\\nThe blockade, though serious beyond all other military measures,\\nroused less attention and less protest than another measure of the\\nBritish government which had the character of a profitable insult. A\\ncircular dated November 9, addressed to the governors of West Indian\\ncolonies by the British government, authorized them to issue licenses\\nfor importation of necessary supplies during the war,--a precaution\\ncommonly taken to meet the risk of famine in those regions. The\\nGovernor of the Bermudas, in issuing a proclamation January 14, 1813,\\npublished the circular, which contained one unusual provision:[19]--\\n\\n    “Whatever importations are proposed to be m\\n nor any\\nmeasures that could be taken by sea or land, prevented a constant\\ntraffic between Halifax and the New England ports not blockaded. The\\nUnited States government seemed afraid to interfere with it. The\\nnewspapers asserted that hundreds of Americans were actually in Halifax\\ncarrying on a direct trade, and that thousands of barrels of flour were\\nconstantly arriving there from the United States in vessels carrying\\nthe Swedish or other neutral flag. In truth the government could do\\nlittle to enforce its non-intercourse, and even that little might prove\\nmischievous. Nothing could be worse than the spirit of the people on\\nthe frontier. Engaged in a profitable illicit commerce, they could only\\nbe controlled by force, and any force not overwhelming merely provoked\\nviolence or treason. The Navy Department had no vessels to send there,\\nand could not have prevented their capture if vessels in any number had\\nbeen sent. The Secretary of War had abandoned to the State governments\\nthe defence \\n ruining the peasantry. We drive all their cattle, and of\\ncourse ruin them. _My_ hands are clean; but it is hateful to see the\\npoor Yankees robbed, and to be the robber.”\\n\\nCompared with the widespread destruction which war brought on these\\nregions half a century afterward, the injury inflicted by the British\\nnavy in 1813 was trifling, but it served to annoy the Southern\\npeople, who could offer no resistance, and were harassed by incessant\\nmilitia-calls. To some extent the same system of vexation was pursued\\non the Northern coast. The Delaware River was blockaded and its\\nshores much annoyed. New York was also blockaded, and Nantucket with\\nthe adjacent Sounds became a British naval station. There Sir Thomas\\nHardy, Nelson’s favorite, officer, commanded, in his flag-ship the\\n“Ramillies.” Hardy did not encourage marauding such as Cockburn\\npractised, but his blockade was still stringent, and its efficiency was\\nproved by the failure of Decatur’s efforts to evade it.\\n\\nDecatur commanded a squad\\ned States outside of New England did\\nnot exceed $150,000 a month, or at the rate of $1,800,000 a year.[384]\\n\\nNo ordinary operations of war could affect the United States so\\nseverely as this inexorable blockade. Every citizen felt it in every\\naction of his life. The farmer grew crops which he could not sell,\\nwhile he paid tenfold prices for every necessity. While the country\\nwas bursting with wealth, it was ruined. The blockade was but a part\\nof the evil. The whole coast was systematically swept of the means of\\nindustry. Especially the Virginians and Marylanders felt the heavy hand\\nof England as it was felt nowhere else except on the Niagara River. A\\nlarge British squadron occupied Chesapeake Bay, and converted it into\\na British naval station. After the month of February, 1813, the coasts\\nof Virginia and Maryland enjoyed not a moment’s repose. Considering the\\nimmense naval power wielded by England, the Americans were fortunate\\nthat their chief losses were confined to the farm-yards and \\nn be given to it.”\\n\\nAlthough Madison pointed to the notorious supply of food for the\\nBritish forces in Canada as one of the motives for imposing an embargo,\\nno one supposed that motive to be decisive. Other laws already forbade\\nand punished such communication with the enemy; and experience proved\\nthat a general embargo would be no more effective than any special\\nprohibition. The idea that England could be distressed by an embargo\\nseemed still less likely to influence Government. Congress knew that\\nRussia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, Spain, and South America\\nwere already open to English commerce, and that a few days must decide\\nwhether Napoleon could much longer prevent Great Britain from trading\\nwith France. The possibility of distressing England by closing Boston\\nand Salem, New Bedford and Newport to neutral ships was not to be\\nseriously treated.\\n\\nWhatever was the true motive of the President’s recommendation,\\nCongress instantly approved it. The next day, December 10, the Hou\\nculty in obtaining it; but he would hardly have arranged a system\\nof signals as visible to Decatur as to himself. Even had he done so, he\\nmight have employed men in his own service as well as Americans for the\\npurpose. Decatur’s letter admitted that he had made great exertions to\\ndetect the culprits, but without success.\\n\\nThe rigor of the British blockade extended no farther north than\\nthe Vineyard and Nantucket. Captain Broke in the “Shannon,” with a\\ncompanion frigate, cruised off Boston harbor rather to watch for\\nships-of-war than to interfere with neutral commerce. Along the coast\\nof Maine an illicit trade with the British provinces was so actively\\npursued that one of the few American sloops-of-war, the “Enterprise,”\\ncruised there, holding smugglers, privateers, and petty marauders in\\ncheck. On no other portion of the coast would an armed national vessel\\nhave been allowed to show itself, but the “Enterprise,” protected\\nby the bays and inlets of Maine, and favored by the absence of a\\nst India colonies were kept in constant discomfort and starvation\\nby swarms of semi-piratical craft darting in and out of every channel\\namong their islands; but the people of England could have borne with\\npatience the punishment of the West Indies had not the American\\ncruisers inflicted equally severe retribution nearer home.\\n\\nGreat Britain was blockaded. No one could deny that manifest danger\\nexisted to any merchant-vessel that entered or left British waters.\\nDuring the summer the blockade was continuous. Toward the close of\\n1812 an American named Preble, living in Paris, bought a small vessel,\\nsaid to have belonged in turn to the British and French navy, which\\nhe fitted as a privateer-brig, carrying sixteen guns and one hundred\\nand sixty men. The “True-Blooded Yankee,” commanded by Captain Hailey,\\nsailed from Brest March 1, 1813, and cruised thirty-seven days on\\nthe coasts of Ireland and Scotland, capturing twenty-seven valuable\\nvessels; sinking coasters in the very bay of Dublin; la\\ns probably the\\nleast adapted to negotiation, but while England was at the moment of\\nher most extravagant sense of power, President Madison received and\\naccepted Castlereagh’s offer to negotiate, and Gallatin went with\\nBayard to London to hasten the approach of peace.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV.\\n\\n\\nCONGRESS assembled Dec. 6, 1813, at a time of general perplexity.\\nThe victories of Perry and Harrison, September 10 and October 5, had\\nrecovered Detroit and even conquered a part of West Canada, but their\\nsuccesses were already dimmed by the failures of Wilkinson and Hampton\\nbefore Montreal, and the retreat of both generals November 13 within\\nUnited States territory. In the Creek country the Georgians had failed\\nto advance from the east, and Jackson was stopped at Fort Strother\\nby want of supplies and men.

I remarked to him that among our advantages we must\\n    doubtless count the fact that the coalition had ten heads, while\\n    France had but one. ‘And what a powerful head!’ replied the\\n    President, instantly, with less grace than conviction in his whole\\n    countenance.”\\n\\nThe vigor of Napoleon postponed for a few months the total downfall of\\nSerurier’s influence, but it slowly waned, and he became more and more\\ngrateful for consideration shown him.

A rigorous embargo\\n    can alone prevent such crim\\nngress showed by its\\nindifference to the two supplementary bills that it had abandoned the\\nPresident’s system as early as January, but the embargo continued\\nthroughout the winter, and the month of March passed without its\\nremoval.

In theory, the overthrow of Napoleon\\nshould have not essentially affected the embargo or the Non-importation\\nActs, which were expected to press upon England independently of\\nNapoleon’s Continental system; but in practice the embargo having\\nproduced no apparent effect on Europe during the war, could not be\\nexpected to produce an e\\nuropean nations that were gathering their utmost resources for\\nresistance to Napoleon’s attack.

Germany, waiting only for\\nstrength to recover her freedom, had to reckon against one more element\\nin Napoleon’s vast military resources.

Even in America, no one doubted the earnestness of England’s\\nwish for peace; and if Madison and Monroe insisted on her acquiescence\\nin their terms, they insisted because they believed that their military\\nposition entitled them to expect it. The reconquest of Russia and\\nSpain by Napoleon, an event almost certain to happen, could hardly fail\\nto force from England the concessio\\nn overwhelming force of ships-of-the-line and frigates to the\\nAmerican coast.

Madison’s calculations, reasonable as they seemed\\nto be, were overthrown, and the glow of English delight over the\\nsuccess of Russia made the burden of the American war seem easy to\\nbear. In Parliament hardly a voice was raised for peace.

It never entered into my mind\\n    that we should send a fleet to take rest and shelter in our own\\n    ports in North America, and that we should then attack the American\\n    ports with a flag of truce.”[9]\\n\\nFrom such criticisms Lord Castlereagh had no difficulty in defending\\nhimself. Whitbread alone maintained that injustice had been done to\\nAmerica, and that measures ought to be taken for peace.\\n\\nThis debate took place November 30, two days after the destruction of\\nNapoleon’s army in passing the Beresina. From that moment, and during\\nthe next eighteen months, England had other matters to occupy her mind\\nthan the disagreeable subject of the American war. Napoleon arrived in\\nParis December 18, and set himself to the task of renewing the army of\\nhalf a million men which had been lost in Russia, and of strengthening\\nhis hold on Germany, where a violent popular emotion threatened to\\nbreak into open allianc\\nsty. I remarked to him that among our advantages we must\\n    doubtless count the fact that the coalition had ten heads, while\\n    France had but one. ‘And what a powerful head!’ replied the\\n    President, instantly, with less grace than conviction in his whole\\n    countenance.”\\n\\nThe vigor of Napoleon postponed for a few months the total downfall of\\nSerurier’s influence, but it slowly waned, and he became more and more\\ngrateful for consideration shown him. The President’s Annual Message,\\nDecember 7, met his approval. “All agree that nothing more energetic or\\nmore warlike has yet come from Mr. Madison’s Cabinet.”[484] The secret\\nMessage of December 9 and the embargo pleased him more.\\n\\n    “Mr. Monroe assured me three days ago,” continued Serurier, writing\\n    December 10, “that the Government had been informed of supplies to\\n    the extent of nearly thirty thousand barrels of flour furnished\\n    to Canada from ports of the United States. A rigorous embargo\\n    can alone prevent such crim\\nngress showed by its\\nindifference to the two supplementary bills that it had abandoned the\\nPresident’s system as early as January, but the embargo continued\\nthroughout the winter, and the month of March passed without its\\nremoval. The news from Europe at the close of that month left no doubt\\nthat Napoleon could offer little effectual resistance even in France\\nto the allies, whose armies were known to have crossed the Rhine,\\nwhile Wellington advanced on Bordeaux. Holland was restored to her\\nancient independence, and Napoleon was understood to have accepted in\\nprinciple, for a proposed Congress at Mannheim, the old boundaries of\\nFrance as a basis of negotiation. In theory, the overthrow of Napoleon\\nshould have not essentially affected the embargo or the Non-importation\\nActs, which were expected to press upon England independently of\\nNapoleon’s Continental system; but in practice the embargo having\\nproduced no apparent effect on Europe during the war, could not be\\nexpected to produce an e\\nuropean nations that were gathering their utmost resources for\\nresistance to Napoleon’s attack. Russia could not but regard it as an\\nunfriendly act, equally bad for political and commercial interests.\\nSpain and Portugal, whose armies were fed largely if not chiefly on\\nAmerican grain imported by British money under British protection,\\ndreaded to see their supplies cut off. Germany, waiting only for\\nstrength to recover her freedom, had to reckon against one more element\\nin Napoleon’s vast military resources. England needed to make greater\\nefforts in order to maintain the advantages she had gained in Russia\\nand Spain. Even in America, no one doubted the earnestness of England’s\\nwish for peace; and if Madison and Monroe insisted on her acquiescence\\nin their terms, they insisted because they believed that their military\\nposition entitled them to expect it. The reconquest of Russia and\\nSpain by Napoleon, an event almost certain to happen, could hardly fail\\nto force from England the concessio\\nn overwhelming force of ships-of-the-line and frigates to the\\nAmerican coast. Almost immediately England recovered from her dismay;\\nfor November 11 news arrived that the Russians were again masters of\\nMoscow, and that Napoleon was retreating. Day after day the posts\\narrived from Russia, bringing accounts more and more encouraging, until\\nwhen Parliament met, November 24, the hope that Napoleon might never\\nescape from Russia had become strong.\\n\\nThus the new Ministry found themselves able to face opposition with\\nunexpected strength. Madison’s calculations, reasonable as they seemed\\nto be, were overthrown, and the glow of English delight over the\\nsuccess of Russia made the burden of the American war seem easy to\\nbear. In Parliament hardly a voice was raised for peace. The Marquess\\nWellesley in the debate on the King’s speech attacked ministers,\\nnot because they had brought the country into war with America, but\\nbecause they had been unprepared for it; “they ought as statesmen to\\nhave known\\nantic during the\\nwinter months.\\n\\nWith it went the tale of Napoleon’s immense disaster. October 23 he\\nbegan his retreat; November 23 he succeeded in crossing the Beresina\\nand escaping capture; December 5 he abandoned what was still left of\\nhis army; and December 19, after travelling secretly and without rest\\nacross Europe, he appeared suddenly in Paris, still powerful, but in\\ndanger. Nothing could be better calculated to support the Russian\\nmediation in the President’s mind. The possibility of remaining without\\na friend in the world while carrying on a war without hope of success,\\ngave to the Czar’s friendship a value altogether new.\\n\\nOther news crossed the ocean at the same time, but encouraged no hope\\nthat England would give way. First in importance, and not to be trifled\\nwith, was the British official announcement, dated December 26, 1812,\\nof the blockade of the Chesapeake and Delaware.

From his post at the\\nTreasury, Gallatin could see better than most men the dangers, both\\nfinancial and political, engendered by the war, while his acquaintance\\nwith European affairs showed him the need of rapid diplomacy.\\n\\nArmstrong represented everything antagonistic to Gallatin; his methods\\nwere arbitrary and underhand; his political training was that of\\nthe New York school, tempered by personal contact with the court of\\nNapoleon; from him economy could hardly be expected. Yet perhaps\\nthe worst feature of his administration was likely to be his use of\\npatronage. The number of Gallatin’s personal enemies was small, and\\nthe use of patronage in a way that would outrage h\\nbts as to the balance of advantages\\nand disadvantages offered by the privateer system. Perhaps more\\ncareful inquiry might show that, valuable as the privateers were, the\\ngovernment would have done better to retain all military and naval\\nfunctions in its own hands, and to cover the seas with small cruisers\\ncapable of pursuing a system of thorough destruction against the\\nshipping and colonial interests of England.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV.\\n\\n\\nGALLATIN and Bayard, having sailed from the Delaware May 9, arrived\\nat St. Petersburg July 21, only to find that during the six months\\nsince the Czar offered to mediate, Russia had advanced rapidly in\\nevery direction except that of the proposed mediation.
