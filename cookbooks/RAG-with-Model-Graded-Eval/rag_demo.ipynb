      "the effect was ruinous. The New England banks were financial agents\n",
      "of the enemy. The bank capital of Massachusetts including Maine was\n",
      "about twelve and a quarter million dollars; that of Connecticut\n",
      "exceeded three millions. The whole bank capital of New England reached\n",
      "eighteen millions,[477] or nearly one third of the paid bank capital\n",
      "of the whole country, if Pitkin’s estimate was correct. That nearly\n",

      "on which the bank circulation of other States depended.\n",
      "\n",
      "The system of commercial restrictions was responsible for thus, at\n",
      "the most critical moment of the war, throwing the control of the\n",
      "national finances into the hands of the Boston Federalists. Against\n",
      "the protests of the Federalists, manufactures had been forced upon\n",

      "per cent, for the use of these sixteen millions for thirteen years.\n",
      "The terms were not excessive when it was considered that New England\n",
      "in effect refused to subscribe. Perhaps the loan could not have been\n",
      "taken at all, had not credit and currency been already expanded to the\n",
      "danger-point, as the allotment showed; for while New England, where\n",
      "most of the specie was held, subscribed less than half a million, and\n",
      "Boston took but seventy-five thousand, Pennsylvania, where banking had\n",
      "become a frenzy, took seven million dollars. New York and Baltimore\n",
      "together contributed only half a million more than was given by\n",
      "Philadelphia alone. Ten million dollars were taken by Astor, Girard,\n",
      "and Parish,--three foreign-born Americans, without whose aid the money\n",
      "could not have been obtained on these terms, if at all. Doubtless they\n",
      "were bold operators; but Americans were supposed to be not wanting in\n",
      "the taste for speculation, and\n",
      "every moment multiplying. Suffocated with\n",
      "heat, members were forced to sit day by day in the half-finished\n",
      "Capitol, with a Southern village about them, their nearest neighbor a\n",
      "British fleet. “Defeated and disgraced everywhere,” said one of the\n",
      "stanchest war members describing the scene, “Congress was to impose the\n",
      "burden of taxes on a divided people, who had been taught by leaders\n",
      "of the war party to look upon a tax-gatherer as a thief, if not to\n",
      "shoot him as a burglar.”[36] According to the same authority, “the\n",
      "country was at the lowest point of depression, where fear is too apt to\n",
      "introduce despair.” In this condition of spirits, Gallatin’s tax-bills\n",
      "were reported to the House June 10,--measures such as the Republican\n",
      "party had, till very lately, not conceived as within the range of its\n",
      "possible legislation. They included a direct tax of three million\n",
      "dollars; taxes on salt, licenses, spirits, carriages, auctions, sugar\n",
      "refineries; a stamp tax, and a complete machinery for the asses\n",
      "lled on Philadelphia and Baltimore.\n",
      "The specie drained to New England could find its way back only by means\n",
      "of government loans, which New England refused to make in any large\n",
      "amount. On the other hand, Boston bought freely British Treasury notes\n",
      "at liberal discount, and sent coin to Canada in payment of them.[481]\n",
      "Probably New England lent to the British government during the war more\n",
      "money than she lent to her own. The total amount subscribed in New\n",
      "England to the United States loans was less than three millions.\n",
      "\n",
      "This situation was well understood by Congress. In the debate of\n",
      "February, 1814, the approaching dangers were repeatedly pointed out.\n",
      "The alarm was then so great that the Committee of Ways and Means\n",
      "reported a bill to incorporate a new national bank with a capital of\n",
      "thirty million dollars, while Macon openly advocated the issue of\n",
      "government paper,[482] declaring that “paper money never was beat.”\n",

      "mill\n",

      "estimated it at seventeen million dollars,[479] and of that amount the\n",
      "banks of New England in 1814 probably held nearly ten millions. The\n",
      "Massachusetts banks, with seven millions in specie, had a bank-note\n",
      "circulation of less than three millions. The Middle, Southern, and\n",
      "Western States must have had a bank-note circulation approaching forty\n",
      "millions in paper, with seven or eight millions in specie to support\n",
      "it,[480] while the paper was constantly increasing in quantity and the\n",
      "specie constantly diminishing. Bank paper, as was believed, could not\n",
      "with safety exceed the proportion of three paper dollars to every\n",
      "specie dollar in the bank vaults; but the banks in 1814 beyond New\n",
      "England were circulating at least four paper dollars to every silver\n",

      "Although Madison pointed to the notorious supply of food for the\n",
      "British forces in Canada as one of the motives for imposing an embargo,\n",
      "no one supposed that motive to be decisive. Other laws already forbade\n",
      "and punished such communication with the enemy; and experience proved\n",
      "that a general embargo would be no more effective than any special\n",
      "prohibition. The idea that England could be distressed by an embargo\n",
      "seemed still less likely to influence Government. Congress knew that\n",
      "Russia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, Spain, and South America\n",
      "were already open to English commerce, and that a few days must decide\n",
      "whether Napoleon could much longer prevent Great Britain from trading\n",
      "with France. The possibility of distressing England by closing Boston\n",
