    context: " wheat to be brought by sea from Charleston or Norfolk to\nBoston. Soon\
      \ speculation began. The price of imported articles rose to\nextravagant points.\
      \ At the end of the year coffee sold for thirty-eight\ncents a pound, after\
      \ selling for twenty-one cents in August. Tea which\ncould be bought for $1.70\
      \ per pound in August, sold for three and four\ndollars in December. Sugar which\
      \ was quoted at nine dollars a hundred\nweight in New Orleans, and in August\
      \ sold for twenty-one or twenty-two\ndollars in New York and Philadelphia, stood\
      \ at forty dollars in\nDecember.\n\nMore sweeping in its effects on exports\
      \ than on imports, the blockade\nrapidly reduced the means of the people. After\
      \ the summer of 1813,\nGeorgia alone, owing to its contiguity with Florida,\
      \ succeeded in\ncontinuing to send out cotton. The exports of New York, which\
      \ exceeded\n$12,250,000 in 1811, fell to $209,000 for the year ending in 1814.\
      \ The\ndomestic exports of Virginia diminished in four years from $4,800,000\n\
      to $3,000,000 for 1812, $1,\nNew England open to neutrals.\nFrom that time nothing\
      \ entered or left the blockaded coast except swift\nprivateers, or occasional\
      \ fast-sailing vessels which risked capture\nin the attempt. Toward the close\
      \ of the year Admiral Warren extended\nhis blockade eastward. Notice of the\
      \ extension was given at Halifax\nNovember 16, and by the blockading squadron\
      \ off New London December 2,\nthus closing Long Island Sound to all vessels\
      \ of every description.[381]\n\nThe pressure of the blockade was immediately\
      \ felt. In August[382]\nsuperfine flour sold at Boston for $11.87 a barrel,\
      \ at Baltimore for\n$6.00, and at Richmond for $4.50. Upland cotton sold at\
      \ Boston for\ntwenty cents a pound; at Charleston for nine cents. Rice sold\
      \ at\nPhiladelphia for $12.00 a hundred weight; in Charleston and Savannah\n\
      for $3.00. Sugar sold in Boston for $18.75 a hundred weight; in\nBaltimore for\
      \ $26.50. Already the American staples were unsalable at\nthe places of their\
      \ production. No rate of profit could cause cotton,\nrice, or\nand supplied\
      \ the Union\nwith articles of necessary use at prices practically fixed by her\
      \ own\nmanufacturers. From the whole country specie began to flow toward\nBoston\
      \ as early as the year 1810, and with astonishing rapidity after\nthe war was\
      \ declared. The British blockade stimulated the movement,\nand the embargo of\
      \ December, 1813, which lasted till April, 1814, cut\noff every other resource\
      \ from the Southern and Western States. Unable\nlonger to send their crops even\
      \ to New England for a market, they were\nobliged to send specie, and they soon\
      \ came to the end of their supply.\nThe Massachusetts banks, which reported\
      \ about $820,000 in specie in\n1809, returned more than $3,680,000 in June,\
      \ 1812; which rose to\n$5,780,000 in June, 1813, and reached nearly $7,000,000\
      \ in June, 1814.\nIn five years the Massachusetts banks alone drew more than\
      \ six million\ndollars in specie from the Southern and Middle States,[478] besides\n\
      what they sent to Canada in payment for British bills.\n\nNo one knew how much\

      \ July 21, 1813\nr was responsible,\nthe effect was ruinous. The New England\
      \ banks were financial agents\nof the enemy. The bank capital of Massachusetts\
      \ including Maine was\nabout twelve and a quarter million dollars; that of Connecticut\n\
      exceeded three millions. The whole bank capital of New England reached\neighteen\
      \ millions,[477] or nearly one third of the paid bank capital\nof the whole\
      \ country, if Pitkin\u2019s estimate was correct. That nearly\none third of\
      \ the national resources should be withdrawn from the aid\nof government was\
      \ serious enough; but in reality the loss was much\ngreater, for New England\
      \ held a still larger proportion of the specie\non which the bank circulation\
      \ of other States depended.\n\nThe system of commercial restrictions was responsible\
      \ for thus, at\nthe most critical moment of the war, throwing the control of\
      \ the\nnational finances into the hands of the Boston Federalists. Against\n\
      the protests of the Federalists, manufactures had been forced upon\nthem by\
      \ national legislation until New Engl\nhe\nrate was about 7.50 per cent. In\
      \ the end, the government paid 7.487\nper cent, for the use of these sixteen\
      \ millions for thirteen years.\nThe terms were not excessive when it was considered\
      \ that New England\nin effect refused to subscribe. Perhaps the loan could not\
      \ have been\ntaken at all, had not credit and currency been already expanded\
      \ to the\ndanger-point, as the allotment showed; for while New England, where\n\
      most of the specie was held, subscribed less than half a million, and\nBoston\
      \ took but seventy-five thousand, Pennsylvania, where banking had\nbecome a\
      \ frenzy, took seven million dollars. New York and Baltimore\ntogether contributed\
      \ only half a million more than was given by\nPhiladelphia alone. Ten million\
      \ dollars were taken by Astor, Girard,\nand Parish,--three foreign-born Americans,\
      \ without whose aid the money\ncould not have been obtained on these terms,\
      \ if at all. Doubtless they\nwere bold operators; but Americans were supposed\
      \ to be not wanting in\nthe taste for speculation, and\nevery moment multiplying.\
      \ Suffocated with\nheat, members were forced to sit day by day in the half-finished\n\
      Capitol, with a Southern village about them, their nearest neighbor a\nBritish\
      \ fleet. \u201CDefeated and disgraced everywhere,\u201D said one of the\nstanchest\
      \ war members describing the scene, \u201CCongress was to impose the\nburden\
      \ of taxes on a divided people, who had been taught by leaders\nof the war party\
      \ to look upon a tax-gatherer as a thief, if not to\nshoot him as a burglar.\u201D\
      [36] According to the same authority, \u201Cthe\ncountry was at the lowest point\
      \ of depression, where fear is too apt to\nintroduce despair.\u201D In this\
      \ condition of spirits, Gallatin\u2019s tax-bills\nwere reported to the House\
      \ June 10,--measures such as the Republican\nparty had, till very lately, not\
      \ conceived as within the range of its\npossible legislation. They included\
      \ a direct tax of three million\ndollars; taxes on salt, licenses, spirits,\
      \ carriages, auctions, sugar\nrefineries; a stamp tax, and a complete machinery\
      \ for the asses\nlled on Philadelphia and Baltimore.\nThe specie drained to\
      \ New England could find its way back only by means\nof government loans, which\
      \ New England refused to make in any large\namount. On the other hand, Boston\
      \ bought freely British Treasury notes\nat liberal discount, and sent coin to\
      \ Canada in payment of them.[481]\nProbably New England lent to the British\
      \ government during the war more\nmoney than she lent to her own. The total\
      \ amount subscribed in New\nEngland to the United States loans was less than\
      \ three millions.\n\nThis situation was well understood by Congress. In the\
      \ debate of\nFebruary, 1814, the approaching dangers were repeatedly pointed\
      \ out.\nThe alarm was then so great that the Committee of Ways and Means\nreported\
      \ a bill to incorporate a new national bank with a capital of\nthirty million\
      \ dollars, while Macon openly advocated the issue of\ngovernment paper,[482]\
      \ declaring that \u201Cpaper money never was beat.\u201D\nCongress after a diffuse\
      \ debate passed only a loan bill for twenty-five\nmill\n, for nothing short\
      \ of a million rations at the Maumee Rapids\ncould serve Harrison\u2019s objects,\
      \ and after two months of effort not a\nration had been carried within fifty\
      \ miles of the spot. In Winchester\u2019s\ncamp at Defiance the men were always\
      \ on half rations, except when they\nhad none at all. During the greater part\
      \ of December they had no flour,\nbut lived on poor beef and hickory roots.\
      \ Typhus swept them away by\nscores; their numbers were reduced to about one\
      \ thousand. The exact\nforce which Harrison had in the field was matter of conjecture,\
      \ for he\nsent no return of any description to the adjutant-general\u2019s office.[52]\n\
      The Government gave him _carte blanche_, and he used it.[53] Chaos and\nmisconduct\
      \ reigned in every department, while he, floundering through\nthe mud along\
      \ his line of two hundred miles front, sought in vain for\na road.\n\nFor the\
      \ train of errors and disasters in the northwest Secretary Eustis\nwas chiefly\
      \ responsible, and his resignation, Dec. 3, 1812, left the\ncampaign in th\n\
      pecie the country contained. Gallatin afterward\nestimated it at seventeen million\
      \ dollars,[479] and of that amount the\nbanks of New England in 1814 probably\
      \ held nearly ten millions. The\nMassachusetts banks, with seven millions in\
      \ specie, had a bank-note\ncirculation of less than three millions. The Middle,\
      \ Southern, and\nWestern States must have had a bank-note circulation approaching\
      \ forty\nmillions in paper, with seven or eight millions in specie to support\n\
      it,[480] while the paper was constantly increasing in quantity and the\nspecie\
      \ constantly diminishing. Bank paper, as was believed, could not\nwith safety\
      \ exceed the proportion of three paper dollars to every\nspecie dollar in the\
      \ bank vaults; but the banks in 1814 beyond New\nEngland were circulating at\
      \ least four paper dollars to every silver\nor gold dollar, and in many cases\
      \ were issuing paper without specie in\ntheir possession.\n\nAlready the banks\
      \ of New England were pressing their demands on those\nof New York, which in\
      \ their turn ca\nn be given to it.\u201D\n\nAlthough Madison pointed to the\
      \ notorious supply of food for the\nBritish forces in Canada as one of the motives\
      \ for imposing an embargo,\nno one supposed that motive to be decisive. Other\
      \ laws already forbade\nand punished such communication with the enemy; and\
      \ experience proved\nthat a general embargo would be no more effective than\
      \ any special\nprohibition. The idea that England could be distressed by an\
      \ embargo\nseemed still less likely to influence Government. Congress knew that\n\
      Russia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, Spain, and South America\nwere\
      \ already open to English commerce, and that a few days must decide\nwhether\
      \ Napoleon could much longer prevent Great Britain from trading\nwith France.\
      \ The possibility of distressing England by closing Boston\nand Salem, New Bedford\
      \ and Newport to neutral ships was not to be\nseriously treated.\n\nWhatever\
      \ was the true motive of the President\u2019s recommendation,\nCongress instantly\
      \ approved it. The next day, December 10, the Hou\ny 4, from\nFranklinton,--\n\
      \n    \u201CWhen I was directed to take the command in the latter end of\n \
      \   September, I thought it possible by great exertions to effect the\n    objects\
      \ of the campaign before the setting in of winter.... The\n    experience of\
      \ a few days was sufficient to convince me that the\n    supplies of provisions\
      \ could not be procured for our autumnal\n    advance; and even if this difficulty\
      \ was removed, another of equal\n    magnitude existed in the want of artillery.\
      \ There remained then no\n    alternative but to prepare for a winter campaign.\u201D\
      \n\nAccording to this account he had seen early in October that advance was\n\
      impossible, yet he wasted millions of money and many of his best troops\nin\
      \ attempting it. Winter had come, and he was pledged to a winter\ncampaign as\
      \ impracticable as the autumn campaign had proved to be.\nWithout the control\
      \ of the Lake, any army beyond the Maumee must starve\nor surrender. The government\
      \ had already paid a vast price in money and\nmen in order to o\n819,000 for\
      \ 1813, and $17,581 for the year\nending Sept. 30, 1814. At the close of 1813\
      \ exports, except from\nGeorgia and New England, ceased.[383]\n\nOn the revenue\
      \ the blockade acted with equal effect. Owing to the\nincrease of duties and\
      \ to open ports, the New England States rather\nincreased than diminished their\
      \ customs receipts. Until the summer of\n1813, when the blockade began in earnest,\
      \ New York showed the same\nresult; but after that time the receipts fell, until\
      \ they averaged\nless than $50,000 a month instead of $500,000, which would\
      \ have been\na normal average if peace had been preserved. Philadelphia suffered\n\
      sooner. In 1810 the State of Pennsylvania contributed more than\n$200,000 a\
      \ month to the Treasury; in 1813 it contributed about $25,000\na month. Maryland,\
      \ where was collected in 1812 no less than $1,780,000\nof net revenue, paid\
      \ only $182,000 in 1813, and showed an actual excess\nof expenditures in 1814.\
      \ After the summer, the total net revenue\ncollected in every port of the Unit\n\

      \ they may open them in dust and\n    smoke and steam, to the perpetual whirl\
      \ of spools and spindles and\n    the grating of rasps and saws.\u201D\n\nPotter\
      \ of Rhode Island, where the new manufactures centred, spoke hotly\nagainst\
      \ the change. Much Federalist capital had been drawn into the\nmanufacturing\
      \ business as well as into speculation in all articles of\nnecessity which the\
      \ blockade and the embargo made scarce. At heart\nthe Federalists were not unanimous\
      \ in wishing for a repeal of the\nrestrictive system, and Potter represented\
      \ a considerable class whose\ninterests were involved in maintaining high prices.\
      \ He admitted that\nth\n27, 1814,[152] when the war\nhad lasted two years,--\n\
      \n    \u201CTwo thirds of the army in Canada are at this moment eating beef\n\
      \    provided by American contractors, drawn principally from the States\n \
      \   of Vermont and New York. This circumstance, as well as that of the\n   \
      \ introduction of large sums of specie into this province, being\n    notorious\
      \ in the United States, it is to be expected Congress\n    will take steps to\
      \ deprive us of those resources, and under that\n    apprehension, large droves\
      \ are daily crossing the lines coming into\n    Lower Canada.\u201D\n\nThis\
      \ state of things had then lasted during three campaigns, from\nthe beginning\
      \ of the war. The Indians at Malden, the British army at\nNiagara, the naval\
      \ station at Kingston were largely fed by the United\nStates. If these supplies\
      \ could be stopped, Upper Canada must probably\nfall; and they could be easily\
      \ stopped by interrupting the British line\nof transport anywhere on the St.\
      \ Lawrence.\n\nThe task was not difficult. Indeed, early in the\nsty. I remarked\
      \ to him that among our advantages we must\n    doubtless count the fact that\
      \ the coalition had ten heads, while\n    France had but one. \u2018And what\
      \ a powerful head!\u2019 replied the\n    President, instantly, with less grace\
      \ than conviction in his whole\n    countenance.\u201D\n\nThe vigor of Napoleon\
      \ postponed for a few months the total downfall of\nSerurier\u2019s influence,\
      \ but it slowly waned, and he became more and more\ngrateful for consideration\
      \ shown him. The President\u2019s Annual Message,\nDecember 7, met his approval.\
      \ \u201CAll agree that nothing more energetic or\nmore warlike has yet come\
      \ from Mr. Madison\u2019s Cabinet.\u201D[484] The secret\nMessage of December\
      \ 9 and the embargo pleased him more.\n\n    \u201CMr. Monroe assured me three\
      \ days ago,\u201D continued Serurier, writing\n    December 10, \u201Cthat the\
      \ Government had been informed of supplies to\n    the extent of nearly thirty\
      \ thousand barrels of flour furnished\n    to Canada from ports of the United\
      \ States. A rigorous embargo\n    can alone prevent such crim\ned States outside\
      \ of New England did\nnot exceed $150,000 a month, or at the rate of $1,800,000\
      \ a year.[384]\n\nNo ordinary operations of war could affect the United States\
      \ so\nseverely as this inexorable blockade. Every citizen felt it in every\n\
      action of his life. The farmer grew crops which he could not sell,\nwhile he\
      \ paid tenfold prices for every necessity. While the country\nwas bursting with\
      \ wealth, it was ruined. The blockade was but a part\nof the evil. The whole\
      \ coast was systematically swept of the means of\nindustry. Especially the Virginians\
      \ and Marylanders felt the heavy hand\nof England as it was felt nowhere else\
      \ except on the Niagara River. A\nlarge British squadron occupied Chesapeake\
      \ Bay, and converted it into\na British naval station. After the month of February,\
      \ 1813, the coasts\nof Virginia and Maryland enjoyed not a moment\u2019s repose.\
      \ Considering the\nimmense naval power wielded by England, the Americans were\
      \ fortunate\nthat their chief losses were confined to the farm-yards and\n \
      \ signed, and that the United States were to remain alone on the\n    field\
      \ of battle. It was then that Mr. Madison, abruptly and without\n    having\
      \ in any way prepared the public for it, addressed to Congress\n    the Message\
      \ recommending an immediate repeal of the embargo and a\n    partial repeal\
      \ of the non-importation.\u201D\n\nWhile Serurier explained the suddenness of\
      \ Madison\u2019s action by the need\nof conciliating the Continental powers\
      \ and the manufacturing cities of\nEngland, he added that domestic difficulties\
      \ had a large share in the\ndecision. Contraband trade had become general in\
      \ the Eastern States.\nA sort of civil war, he said, was beginning between the\
      \ officers of\ncustoms and the smugglers; the Government also felt serious anxiety\
      \ for\nthe success of its loan, and began to doubt its ability to maintain\n\
      payments for the army and navy. Revenue had become necessary. Such\nwas the\
      \ terror caused by the French news that the capitalists who had\noffered to\
      \ contract for the loan began to withdra\nions, and an Act for the issue of\
      \ five million interest-bearing\nTreasury notes, leaving with the President\
      \ the option to issue five\nmillions more in case he could not borrow it. The\
      \ legislation was\nevidently insufficient, and satisfied no one. \u201CYou have\
      \ authorized a\nloan for twenty-five millions,\u201D said Grundy in the debate\
      \ of April 2,\n\u201Cand have provided for the expenditure of so much money.\
      \ Where is the\nmoney?\u201D\n\nWithout attempting to answer this question,\
      \ April 18 Congress\nadjourned.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n\nWHILE Congress was\
