# Function Calling with OpenAI

This example is taken from https://github.com/openai/openai-node/blob/v4/examples/function-call-stream.ts and modified to show the same functionality using AIConfig.

The Colab motebook includes a mock database of books and functions to list, search, and retrieve books. It illustrates how to use the AI model to interpret a user's question, determine the appropriate function to call, and execute the function. This notebook serves as a practical guide for leveraging AIConfig and function calling with OpenAI models.
