        "This notebook serves as a practical guide for leveraging AIConfig and function calling with Anyscale Endpoints. We start with a mock database of books and functions to list, search, and retrieve books. Function calling is enabled so the LLM can interpret a user's question, determine the appropriate function to call, and execute the function. \n",
